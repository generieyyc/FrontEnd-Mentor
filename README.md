## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

1. Use landmarks and be aware of accessibility rules especially in the images that I used. 
2. Incorporate my flexbox container into grid for easier centering
3. Use relative sizong to make the design adjustable based on the screen size. 
4. Learned how to use background image.
5. Flex-wrap is very useful to make sure that sizes adjust depending on the view.


### Continued development

This is my first practice on flexbox. I am getting the hang of it but still lots of things to learn. I will focus more on using grid, simplifying my code and practice on changing pictues for mobile.
